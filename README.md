## Reviews:

##### Tiny Capybara Games:
Oh man I want moreee. I'd really like to see a full version of this game at some point. The music gives it a super eerie tone and it fits so well with the atmosphere. Great work

##### Divine Gardener Studios:
This game was super fun, original, and the fire and using portal effects were beautiful 5 stars all around I wish there were more levels

##### kets
A very neat concept!
